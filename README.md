# MONSTr website

This is a template for [a simple Quarto website](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-simple/) (`type: website`).

## GitHub Set-up

* Edit the repo description and Readme to add a link to the webpage. When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the  Settings > Pages page to find the url to the Quarto website

## Customize

* Edit the qmd or md files in the `content` folder. qmd files can include code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles (like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).
* Add the files to `_quarto.yml`
