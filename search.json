    "text": "Purpose\nThis website introduces a comprehensive dataset on the universe of United States military operations from 1989-2021 from a single source: Wikipedia. Using automated extraction techniques on its two structured knowledge databases-Wikidata and DBpedia-we uncover information about individual operations within nearly every post-1989 military intervention described in existing academic datasets. The data we introduce offers unprecedented coverage and granularity that enables analysis of myriad factors associated with when, where, and how the United States employs military force.\nMONSTr covers operation-level events occurring within the auspices of a military intervention. Each observation thus represents:\nA series of tactical actions (battles, engagements, strikes) conducted by combat forces in an operational theater to achieve strategic or campaign objectives in the context of a political issue or dispute through action against a foreign adversary. Routine military movements and operations without a defined target like military training exercises, the routine forward deployment of military troops, non-combatant evacuation operations, and disaster relief are excluded."

    "text": "Disaggregating military interventions\nMONSTr is designed to augment existing military intervention datasets by disaggregating US military interventions into their component military operations. Doing so produces new fine-grained variables that can be combined with the existing datasets to answer important questions.\nMONSTr is fully interoperable with the following existing datasets:\n\nInternational Military Interventions (IMI) (Pearson and Baumann 1993; Kisangani and Pickering 2008; Pickering and Kisangani 2009)\nMilitary Interventions by Powerful States (MIPS) (Sullivan and Koch 2009)\nMilitary Interventions Project (MIP) (Kushi and Toft 2022)\nRAND Report on Characteristics of Successful U.S. Military Interventions (Kavanagh et al. 2019)\n\nWe identify the nested relationships among US operations. Which operations are a part of which broader operations? Under what wars do each of these operations fall? We match these data to existing interventions datasets that contain information about the broader interventions in which these operations occurred."

    "text": "A Wiki-based Dataset of Military Operations with Novel Strategic Technologies (MONSTr)\nJ Andrés Gannon and Kerry Chávez\nRevise & Resubmit\nAbstract: Research on strategies and force structures in modern warfare is prolific but siloed. While some examine boots on the ground, others focus on aerial bombing or unmanned platforms. Consequently, most studies focus on the effects of one approach, seldom considering it in lieu of or conjunction with others. Furthermore, there is less knowledge on the origins and implementations of these strategic choices analyzed in isolation. The primary reason for these gaps lies with data limitations. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive dataset on the universe of US military interventions from 1989-2019. Scraped from the understructure of Wikipedia using SPARQL, a database query language, we offer unprecedented coverage and granularity that enables analysis of myriad determinants—domestic, international, geographic, temporal—of how states fight. The data are also nested, providing opportunities to model interventions in the strategic campaigns and operations in which they were planned. We describe and demonstrate the data’s contents and utility, then suggest how the novel, fine-grained information can contribute to theories about the effects of technological innovation on international conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-print\n\n\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\n\n\n\n\nRepo\n\n\n\n\nFighting in the War Room: Electoral Sources of Civil-Military Contentions in Conflict\nKerry Chávez and J Andrés Gannon\nWorking paper\nAbstract: The traditional theory of democratic victory depicts democracies as superior warfighters because of their stringent selection into war and battlefield effectiveness. This finding does not seem to hold in unconventional contexts, which are increasingly common in the modern era. Existing literature cites military myopia, a cultural argument, and capital-rich force structures, an economic hypothesis. Both assume a flawed elite and fail to explain important variation in how democracies prosecute unconventional wars. We introduce a theory that combines the strategic incentives and constraints of political and military leaders to explain the conditions under which they select suboptimal strategies. Using original data on all US militarized interventions since 1989, we demonstrate that domestic political constraints constrict military planners to risk-mitigating strategies through high technology. High-tech approaches are usually poor counterstrategies in unconventional conflicts, resulting in not only reduced progress but retrogression of political objectives, even loss. This contributes to the literatures on the domestic politics of war, elite dynamics, and US foreign policy by examining the linkages between the public, elites, and international adversaries to provide a more comprehensive explanation for variation in the use of military force.\nThe Whole Package: The Tailoring of US Force Structure Combinations in Modern Warfare\nKerry Chávez and J Andrés Gannon\nWorking paper\nAbstract: Research on force structures in modern warfare is prolific, but siloed. While some examine boots on the ground, others focus on aerial bombing or unmanned platforms. Consequently, few studies consider them in conjunction. Meanwhile, modern warfare features an increasingly broad spectrum of combatants and technologies. With civil war now constituting more than 90% of contemporary armed clashes, diverse nonstate actors regularly contest state powers through terrorism, insurgency, and irregular warfare. Yet interstate wars endure and great power competition persists, compelling states to prepare for these higher-stakes antagonisms accordingly. As a result, advanced modern militaries are cross-pressured to equip and train for dramatically dissimilar security threats. At the same time, political leaders face domestic constraints to avert risks and costs. The United States, with a sharp qualitative military edge and enemies ranging from ragtag rebels to global powerhouses, is a paragon of this challenge. In this paper, we analyze US force structure combinations by their commonness and context. Leveraging original data on the means of force used in all US military interventions from 1989 to 2019, we describe and explain how war planners tailor applications of force to balance military efficacy with domestic and resource constraints."
